# Django Framework
-  Django is high level web framework that eases the pain of building dynamic web sites . its abstract 
   common problems of web development. The django framework is written in Python, a beautiful, concise, powerful, high-level programming language. To develop a site using
   Django, you write Python code that uses the Django libraries. 

- Python is an interpreted language, which means there’s no need to compile code. Just write your   
  program and execute it.In Web development, this means you can develop code and immediately see results by hitting “reload” in your Web browser.Python is dynamically typed, which means you don’t have to worry about declaring data types for your variables.Python syntax is concise yet expressive, which means it takes less code to accomplish the same task than in other, more verbose, languages such as Java. One line of python usually equals 10 lines of Java. (This has a convenient side benefit:
  Fewer lines of code means fewer bugs.)Python offers powerful introspection and meta-programming features, which make it possible to inspect and add behavior to objects at runtime.
